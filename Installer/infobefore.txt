Welcome to the installation application for the Bridgemate Timer.

This program does as its title says: it can be used to help bridge players to finish their boards against an opponent on time.

If you think the application can be improved there are two ways open to you:
1. Improve the code yourself by downloading the sources from https://github.com/Steffens-Bridgemate/Bridge-timer
2. Make a suggestion to the author: steffens@bridgemate.nl
